# OIDC and delegated authentication

## Compatibility/OIDC-aware mode

[MSC2965: OIDC provider discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965)
[MSC3824: OIDC aware clients](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3824)
Produces compatibility sessions.
This mode uses an SSO-like flow to gain a `loginToken` from the authentication provider, then continues with SSO login.
Element Web uses [MSC2965: OIDC provider discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965) to discover the configured provider.
Wherever valid MSC2965 configuration is discovered, OIDC-aware login flow will be the only option offered.

## (ðŸ§ªExperimental) OIDC-native flow

Can be enabled by a config only setting in `config.json`

```json
{
    "settings_defaults": {
        "feature_oidc_native_flow": true
    }
}
```

See https://areweoidcyet.com/client-implementation-guide/.

Element Web uses [MSC2965: OIDC provider discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965) to discover the configured provider.
Where OIDC native login flow is enabled and valid MSC2965 configuration is discovered, OIDC native login flow will be the only login option offered.
Element Web will attempt to [dynamically register](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html) with
the configured OP.
Then, authentication will be completed [as described here](https://areweoidcyet.com/client-implementation-guide/).

#### Statically configured OIDC clients

Clients that are already registered with the OP can configure `client_ids` in `config.json`.
Where static configuration exists for the OP dynamic client registration will not be attempted.

```json
{
    "oidc_static_clients": {
        "https://dummyoidcprovider.com/": {
            "client_id": "abc123"
        }
    }
}
```
